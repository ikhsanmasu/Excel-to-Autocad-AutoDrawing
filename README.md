This Project is used to automate one of my jobs to create a drawing document of the Interlocking Table for railway signaling.
Sorry for the mess haha this was my first project using Python and Qt Designer. You can start to check the main.py then check all connections from there.
This project reads an Excel file and then uses activeX API that can connect Python with AutoCAD.
