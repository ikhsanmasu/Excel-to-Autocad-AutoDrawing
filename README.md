This Project is used to automate one part of my job which is creating a drawing document of the Interlocking Table for railway signaling.
Sorry for the mess haha this was my first project using Python and Qt Designer. You can start to check the main.py and then check all connections from here.
<br />
This project reads an Excel file and then uses Pyautocad module that runs ActiveX API that connects Python with AutoCAD.
We can give tasks to Autocad to create text, lines, or circles. then we can modify those threes to make the drawing we want.
